RISK MANAGEMENT:
- SL @ 1.5x ATR
- HALF of entry TP @ 1x ATR
- HALF of entry TP @ 3x ATR
- IFF 1x ATR is hit, move SL to Entry price

ENTRY:
- C1 (SSL Indicator) Cross
- Price closed above/below Baseline for Long/Short AND is within 1x ATR of Baseline; if not within 1x ATR, must get there by 2 candles, else must wait for C1 flip or new Baseline cross
- Volume MA cross agrees
- NOTE: 1x ATR within 2 candles rule only applies to a Baseline cross; we can enter anytime after a C1 cross provided we eventually get within 1x ATR of Baseline
- NOTE: If we lost due to a Baseline cross before hitting first TP on the previous trade, we MUST wait for either a C1 or Volume MA flip before entering next trade

EXIT:
- Price triggers 3x ATR TP
- Price triggers SL
- C1 flip
- Baseline cross IFF we have not already hit first TP OR we have hit first TP and are not in a losing trade

CONTINUATION:
- If we took profit on last trade, all Entry rules apply, except we can get within 1x ATR at any time (not just 2 candles)
- NOTE: A trade is only a Continuation if it does NOT cross the Baseline; once price closes across the Baseline, we are back to a regular Entry
